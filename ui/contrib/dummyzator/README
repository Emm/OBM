=== Dummizator ===

These scripts are used to fill the OBM database with as many dummy values
as you want. You give the number of users you wanna create, and all the others
things (such as groups, contacts, events, etc.) are calculated from this number,
using various hardcoded scales values (in generators.php).

Usage :
1. Create a fresh install of OBM with the database only altered by the OBM
   install script.
2. Run do.php. It will read the database name/login/pass from the OBM conf.
3. All all goes right, you'll get :
   - A new domain foobar
   - Your users with logins from 'u1' to 'u<nb_users>' and password 'password'.
   - Users lastnames begin with 'U' and contacts lastnames with 'C'
