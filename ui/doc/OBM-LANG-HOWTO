OBM supports Internationalization by including externals lang files.
OBM doesn't deal with character sets but I think this is a browser issue.

Like for themes, adding a new language in OBM is fairly simple

- Create a directory named by your lang name in the directory php/lang
It is important to respect the lang definitions (ex: it for Italy...)

$ cd php/lang
$ mkdir newlang


- Cd to this new directory and copy all the files found in php/lang/en here.

$ cd newlang
$ cp ../en/* .


- Edit and modify the files you've just created.
There is one file per section (company, contact, deal, settings) one header
file, a file named check_date_js.inc and an image flag-lang.gif.

* The image is displayed in the settings screen. It must be a flag of the
country and it must be called flag-newlang.gif .

* check_date_js.inc is a JavaScript function that check a date validity. It
depends on the language because date depends on it (DD/MM/YYYY in french,
MM/DD/YYYY in english plus the ISO format YYYY-MM-DD which is incorporated in
each language).

* Each others files are sets of lines like (where "l_" stands for label) :
$l_contact_name = "Contact Name";
$l_from_company = "From_company";

Just replace the values found here by yours.
And your are done.

Example : adding french support

cd php/lang
mkdir fr
cd fr
cp ../en/* .
cp /mypath/my_image_is_a_french_flag ./flag-fr.gif 

---
emacs contact.inc

$l_contact_name = "Nom Contact";      // replacing "Contact Name"
...
