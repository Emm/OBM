An OBM theme consist of a group of images, icons and colors which OBM uses for
its display. All images, icons and colors in OBM can be changed using themes.
<P>
<H2>To create a theme :</H2>

<UL>
<LI> Create a directory named by your theme name in the directory php/obminclude/themes (was php/themes for 0.2.x)
<P>
$ cd php/obminclude/themes<BR>
$ mkdir newtheme<P>


<LI> Cd to this new directory and create a file named theme.inc (the best way
is to copy the theme.inc file found in php/obminclude/themes/standard)
<P>
$ cd newtheme<BR>
$ cp ../standard/theme.inc .<P>

<LI> Edit and modify this file (theme.inc) to suit your needs and taste.
This file is a set of lines like :<P>
$text_color = "01AB78";           # Color value in hex<BR>
$first_image = "image_name.jpg";  # name of the image<P>

Just replace the values found here by yours.
</UL>

OBM looks for images you set in the theme.inc file in the theme directory.
<BR>
So in this example, the newtheme directory should contain :<P>

$ ls<BR>
theme.inc<BR>
image_name.jpg<BR>
<P>
