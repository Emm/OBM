OBM supports Internationalization by including externals lang files.
OBM doesn't deal with character sets but I think this is a browser issue.
Like for themes, adding a new language in OBM is fairly simple.
<P>
<H2>To add a new language :</H2>

<UL>
<LI> Create a directory named by your lang name in the directory php/obminclude/lang (was php/lang in 0.2.x).
It is important to respect the lang definitions (ex: it for Italy...)
<P>
$ cd php/obminclude/lang<BR>
$ mkdir newlang<P>


<LI> Cd to this new directory and copy all the files found in php/obminclude/lang/en here.
<P>
$ cd newlang<BR>
$ cp ../en/* .<P>


<LI> Edit and modify the files you've just created.
<BR>
There is one file per section (company, contact, deal, settings, user) one
header file, a file named check_date_js.inc and an image flag-lang.gif.
<P>
<UL>
<LI> The image is displayed in the settings screen. It must be a flag of the
country and it must be called flag-newlang.gif .

<LI> check_date_js.inc is a JavaScript function that check a date validity. It
depends on the language because date depends on it (DD/MM/YYYY in french,
MM/DD/YYYY in english plus the ISO format YYYY-MM-DD which is incorporated in
each language).

<LI> Each others files are sets of lines like (where "l_" stands for label) :<P>
$l_contact_name = "Contact Name";<BR>
$l_from_company = "From company";<P>

Just replace the values found here by yours.
And your are done.
</UL>
</UL>
<P>

<H2>Example : adding french support</H2>

cd php/obminclude/lang<BR>
mkdir fr<BR>
cd fr<BR>
cp ../en/* .<BR>
cp /mypath/my_image_is_a_french_flag ./flag-fr.gif <P>

---<BR>
emacs contact.inc<P>

$l_contact_name = "Nom Contact";      // replacing "Contact Name"<BR>
...<BR>
