<h2>History</h2>

OBM started in 1998 as an internal project at Aliacom (the company I work for) which
goal was to manage our contact and customer database.
We hadn't any tool to deal with our business, so we implemented a basic
contract management to serve our needs. Then many ideas came to our minds to
upgrade this tool.
<P>
As we are deeply in free software (we are a Linux solutions provider) we
thought that this thing could become a good candidate for an open source
development.
We then continued development with a GPL release in mind (translation of the
code in english language, more structured sections,...).
We added advanced global capabilities that should be added first to avoid too
much work later as International support, Theme support, Session support,...
Session support means that 2 different people can use OBM with different
language or theme in the same time.
<P>
We worked on the global architecture to make OBM easily expandable.
For example, you don't have to dive in the source code to add an other
language, or an other theme.
You just have to translate messages that are in a separated text file
and OBM will automatically integrate it.
<BR>This around may 1999.
<P>
Through 2nd half of 1999 we updated OBM to correct bugs or integrate new
features but with little time and focus on it. This period ended with 2000,
0.2.4 coming out and a great thing.
We have signed a contract with "<B>l'Observatoire Europeen de l'Audiovisuel
(O.E.A.)</B>" to develop a web contact database which will be based on OBM and
remain under the GPL licence (so we can use OBM code).
We then agree with them to first implement the features needed in OBM and then
fork the project to deal with the specific data of the O.E.A. 
<P>
This brought out version 0.3.x with new features (user management,
authentication, multidatabase support, new design).


<H3>Versions 0.4.x</H3>
Versions 0.4.x saw many developments but without a leading goal.
Different people worked on it but the project was lacking a clear and global objective.
<br>The needed list module had been created,
<br>a computer module has been created but anyone may ask how does it fit within the OBM project,
<br>a new class with great ideas has been created (OBM_DISPLAY) but with severe design flaws.
<br> a needed shared calendar was designed.
<br> The deal module was improved with the parentdeal entity which allow to group individuals deals.
<P>
OBM 0.4 was out with code and functionnality enhancements.
The development guidlines had been slightly update to improve code maintenance.
The database model had been update too, the list and computer module were
definitively integrated. Hence the Mailing functionality in the company module
was deprecated, better handled by the list module (generic, no more single
mailing limitation, infos can come from other tables, Contact and Company, and
better suited for mailshots or mailings).
The deal module had integrated the parentdeal entity to improve scalability.
<P>
But, some global polishment was needed and code had moved in too many directions.
Lang files were becoming unmaintenable. So a major rewrite to harmonize and correct all these points was needed.
<BR>
"A background feeling that is getting stronger is that we must work on the
design (from user perspective) to reach high quality and usability.
We must start thinking of well defined directions and goals.
For example, today what is the logical behind the computer module in OBM ? 
"
<P>
It took a long time but was vital to the project and led to 0.5.0.


<h3>Versions 0.5.x</h3>
0.5.0 had been released on 2002-02-01 and was a major rewrite with many enhancements.
<p />
A mailing list and the bugzilla bugs and features tracking tools had been set up.
The base modules (Company, Contact, Deal, List, User,) had been completly rewritten.
A new module (time manager) to help track time spent on each tasks, and some enhancements.
New tools had been set up in the admin module (Prefs, Data, Lang) which help
code and data maintenance (translations, Preferences,...).
<br /> 
OBM_DISPLAY class had been greatly improved and simplified.
Code was now cleaner and more consistant in the global project.
<br>
The calendar module was integrated for testing purpose but its code hadn't been reviewed.
<br>The accounting module had been integrated for testing only.
<P>
0.5.1 brought many bug fixes, a new module (time manager) to help track time spent on each tasks, and some enhancements.
<p>
0.5.2 brought many architectures improvements (great sessions with user info, independant debug levels, better bookmarks, security fixes, multiple install, OBM_DISPLAY improvements, new admin tools,...)
<p>
0.5.3 continued on the global architecture clean up and enhancement for 0.6 preparation (session administration, input files rules, internal contact moved to userobm, date handling,..).
<p />
OBM could now be viewed has a great framework for complex web applications. The strategy was now clearer for OBM.


<h3>Versions 0.6.x</h3>

0.6.0 represented a major release with a great amount of work done.
Quality, maintenance and usability had been the main goals.
All the backoffice work (architecture changes) can now be visible through the new theme !
<ul>
  <li>New design and theme (with real design now !)
  <li>XHTML / CSS compliance
  <li>modules are grouped in sections (tabs in the default theme)
  <li>New (cleaner, better, nicer) shared calendar (complete rewrite by Mehdi)
  <li>Better genericity (themes, menus, actions,...)
  <li>New access right model not code intrusive,
  <li>New actions model (theme don't need now some hardcoded info)
  <li>Code quality improvment : Rules defined and applied everywhere for date, url,...
  <li>Lots, lots of clean up, fixes, polishment
  <li>Lots of minor functionalities added
  <li>New web site, documentation, install scripts
</ul>

0.6.1, 0.6.2, 0.6.3, 0.6.4, 0.6.5 and 0.6.6 enhanced and fixed the calendar module, fixed problems and added minor functionnality (new admin code tool to have functions reporting, company and contact can be archived, deal helps, incident admin screen) and fixes (bookmark, permissions,...).
We now have a very capable agenda module with great features (native multi-user, multi-view, meeting handling, fine access rights, each kind of repetition, private events, event validation, email notices, vcalendar export works for evolution & pda,...) and great ui.
<p />

<h3>0.7.x</h3>

0.7.0 represented a major release with major functionnality and usability enhancements.
The project management module had been added and interacts with the totally rewritten time management module with Users, tasks and pogress tracking.
The long waited document module is now here in its initial form.
What's cool is that the document repository can be viewed from both angles (database view and filesystem view).
Document can be linked to entities such as deals.
<br />User groups module has been added too and used in the calendar module. Its use will increase in future releases.
<br />A ToDo module has been integrated from 0.7.1.
Contact lists based on query have been added.

<p />The OBM display handling had been redesigned to allow easier theme management with reducing maintenance and work.
A unique and simple display function (display_page()) is now in charge of the screen display. Each graphical section returns a display block. display_page organize these blocks.
Every attributes are now setted in CSS.
<p>
A great deal of work has been done to make OBM a mature product.


<h3>Status - Current situation - 0.8.x</h3>

With 0.8.0 focus has been the PostgreSQL port, the new access right and profile models, the new Publication module with Contact subscriptions management and many usability enhancements.
<p>
An interesting work has been done to allow easy specific site configuration while keeping compatibility with the OBM generic branch.
This allow to change language translation, select which modules are to be displayed without losing the changes when updating to new versions.

Each sections, modules and some fields in the Company, Contact and Deal module can be toggle hidden or displayed by this new configuration (obm_conf.inc).

<h2>Future developments</h2>

<h3>Functionnality</h3>

A main goal within 0.8.x branch will be to expand workgroup capabilities with 
new modules (forum, resource management and planning, some workflow, light 
content managment with frontpage articles,...).
<p />
Accounting (compta) modules (account, invoice and payment) will be up for a rewrite to integrate smoothly with the deal module.
<p />
Improve marketing data analisys for the COM section (allow forecast, reporting,...).
<p />
The document module will be up for some design updates.
The document repository will be managed automatically by OBM without needing document pathes from Users. Tree viewes will be automatically generated with differents start points (company, doucment types,...) and only pertinent entries will appear (one with document linked).
<br />
Appart from the global repository, Each user will have a personnal document repository where the user could arrange the content (path, access rights and shares...).

<p />
The installation procedure should get a global rewrite (graphical web install could be the goal).



<h3>Architecture</h3>

<b>not urgent</b> : select a new database abstraction layer.
<p />
<b>not urgent</b> : then remove phplib use (after session and auth rewrite finished and new database abstraction layer chosen)


<h3>Others</h3>

Put all the documentation in one central guide (in latex) to be exported in pdf and html.
