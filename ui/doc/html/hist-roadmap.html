<H2>History</H2>

OBM started as an internal project at Aliacom (the company I work for) which
goal was to manage our contact and customer database.
We hadn't any tool to deal with our business, so we implemented a basic
contract management to serve our needs. Then many ideas came to our minds to
upgrade this tool.
<P>
As we are deeply in free software (we are a Linux solutions provider) we
thought that this thing could become a good candidate for an open source
development.
We then continued development with a GPL release in mind (translation of the
code in english language, more structured sections,...).
We added advanced global capabilities that should be added first to avoid too
much work later as International support, Theme support, Session support,...
Session support means that 2 different people can use OBM with different
language or theme in the same time.
<P>
We worked on the global architecture to make OBM easily expandable.
For example, you don't have to dive in the source code to add an other
language, or an other theme.
You just have to translate messages that are in a separated text file
and OBM will automatically integrate it.
<BR>This around may 1999.
<P>
Through 2nd half of 1999 we updated OBM to correct bugs or integrate new
features but with little time and focus on it. This period ended with 2000,
0.2.4 coming out and a great thing.
We have signed a contract with "<B>l'Observatoire Europeen de l'Audiovisuel
(O.E.A.)</B>" to develop a web contact database which will be based on OBM and
remain under the GPL licence (so we can use OBM code).
We then agree with them to first implement the features needed in OBM and then
fork the project to deal with the specific data of the O.E.A. 
<P>
This brought out version 0.3.x with new features (user management,
authentication, multidatabase support, new design).


<H3>Versions 0.4.x</H3>
Versions 0.4.x saw many developments but without a leading goal.
Different people worked on it but the project was lacking a clear and global objective.
<br>The needed list module had been created,
<br>a computer module has been created but anyone may ask how does it fit within the OBM project,
<br>a new class with great ideas has been created (OBM_DISPLAY) but with severe design flaws.
<br> a needed shared calendar was designed.
<br> The deal module was improved with the parentdeal entity which allow to group individuals deals.
<P>
OBM 0.4 was out with code and functionnality enhancements.
The development guidlines had been slightly update to improve code maintenance.
The database model had been update too, the list and computer module were
definitively integrated. Hence the Mailing functionality in the company module
was deprecated, better handled by the list module (generic, no more single
mailing limitation, infos can come from other tables, Contact and Company, and
better suited for mailshots or mailings).
The deal module had integrated the parentdeal entity to improve scalability.
<P>
But, some global polishment was needed and code had moved in too many directions.
Lang files were becoming unmaintenable. So a major rewrite to harmonize and correct all these points was needed.
<BR>
"A background feeling that is getting stronger is that we must work on the
design (from user perspective) to reach high quality and usability.
We must start thinking of well defined directions and goals.
For example, today what is the logical behind the computer module in OBM ? 
"
<P>
It took a long time but was vital to the project and led to 0.5.0.

<H2>Status - Current situation - 0.5.x</H2>
0.5.0 has been released on 2002-02-01 and was a major rewrite with many enhancements.
Current release is 0.5.2.
<P>
A mailing list and the bugzilla bugs and features tracking have been set up.
The base modules (Company, Contact, Deal, List, User,) have been completly rewritten.
A new module (time manager) to help track time spent on each tasks, and some enhancements.
New tools have been set up in the admin module (Prefs, Data, Lang) which help
code and maintain the code and data (translations, Preferences,...).
<br> 
OBM_DISPLAY class has been greatly improved and simplified.
Code is now cleaner and more constant in the global project.
<br>
The calendar module is now integrated for testing purpose, its code hasn't been reviewed.
<br>The accounting module has been integrated for testing only.
<P>
0.5.1 brings many bug fixes, a new module (time manager) to help track time spent on each tasks, and some enhancements.
<p>
0.5.2 brings many architectures improvements (great sessions with user info, independant debug levels, better bookmarks, security fixes, multiple install, OBM_DISPLAY improvements, new admin tools,...)
<p>
The strategy is now clearer for OBM.


<H2>Towards 0.6</H2>

The main goal for the 0.6 version is to have the new section grouping with new UI and the 5 modules for the "sale force" (force de vente) section completly finished and usable.
For now :

</table>
<P>

<H2>Future developments</H2>

We will add the section stage.
A section will be for exemple : <b>sales forces</b> wich will included the modules Company, Contact, Deal, List and Calendar. 

<P>
Work has just started on two new modules. An accounting module and an support
module.
<P>

Then we are planning a new module : The Document Module, designed to
store all the documents a company can produce (letter, bill, ...).
One intersting feature of this module would be the capability to automaticaly
generate a document with data from the database and from a form depending on
the document type.
<BR>
The Document would be generated by specific modules (LaTex, Word, any capable
Linux office tool) which could be added later. We are currently working on the
LaTex module.
<P>
Then maybe a very strong concept of modules where you can choose modules you
want to use, and where OBM knows what to offer depending on the presence of
modules. You could add a module,...
