During installation of obm-config you set the "externalurl" of OBM
server. The ExternalUrl value is the address users will type in their
browsers to access obm.

Once installed and configured, simply open your webbrowser and go to
http://<externalurl>/obm

By default, the domain localhost.localdomain (obm1) is created.  Login
is "admin" and password "admin".  For the global domain (to create
other domain), login is "admin0" and password "admin".

Please change all password to improve security.
